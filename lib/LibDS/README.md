The DriverStation library allows any Qt-based project to manage an FRC robot easily and without getting involved in the application loops and network operations needed to manage the roboRIO.

The library has been written by analyzing the following sites and projects:

- [https://github.com/raystubbs/RobotDS](https://github.com/raystubbs/RobotDS)
- [https://github.com/gluxon/node-driverstation15](https://github.com/gluxon/node-driverstation15)
- [https://github.com/gluxon/node-driverstation15/wiki/2015-Protocol](https://github.com/gluxon/node-driverstation15/wiki/2015-Protocol)

Buy them a beer if you feel that this library or the [QDriverStation](http://github.com/wint-3794/qdriverstation) helped you. Of course, you are welcome to buy us a beer too! (the situation in Mexico for FRC teams is not very good...)

### Wiki

We are also in the process of creating a [wiki](https://github.com/WinT-3794/QDriverStation/wiki) for this project. The idea behind this is for programmers and users alike to understand how our application and the FRC Communication protocols work.
